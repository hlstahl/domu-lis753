				</p> 
			<h4>What are the hours?</h4>
				<p>
				  The book sale takes place the third weekend of every month on Saturdays and Sundays from 8am to 4pm.
				</p>
			<h4>What time should I arrive?</h4>
				<p>

        <section class="even">
        <a id="Entrance"><h3>Entrance &amp; Shopping</h3></a>
			<h4>How do I get into the Main Room?</h4>
				<p>
				  Entrance tickets are handed out on Saturdays from 8am-11am. A maximum of two entrance tickets per person will be handed out. This allows you and one friend or family member entrance to the Main Room.
				</p>
			<h4>How do tickets for the Main Room work?</h4>
				<p>
				  When you arrive, you will be handed a numbered ticket to allow you into the sale. Hang on to it, because your ticket number reserves your spot in line. This keeps things fair and gives you the chance to grab some coffee or browse the other rooms while you’re waiting to enter!
				</p>
				<p>
				Be sure to return to the Main Room a few minutes before it opens to reclaim your spot in line, or your place will be forfeited. 
				</p>
			<h4>What if I'm too late to get a ticket?</h4>
				<p>
				If you do not receive a ticket, don’t worry—you can still shop the Main Room! Just join the end of the line for entrance. 
				</p>
			<h4>Is there a fee at the door?</h4>
				<p>
				  There is no fee for entrance to the book sale.
				</p>
			<h4>How many people are allowed in the Main Room at once?</h4>
				<p>
				  Due to space limitations and compelling issues of health and safety, we will only allow 160 customers into the Main Room at a time.
				</p>
			<h4>How many books can I purchase?</h4>
				<p>
				  In the Main Room between 8am and 12pm, you may purchase up to 12 books. If you’d like to purchase more, you may get back in line to go through the sale again. This helps ensure everyone has the chance to get a great deal on books and other items!
				</p>
				<p>
				If the line continues out the door past 12pm, the limit of 12 books at a time will remain. There is no limit on the number of times you may enter the Main Room.
				</p>
			<h4>Can I purchase a gift certificate?</h4>
				<p>
				  Yes! During the sale, gift certificates are available for purchase in $5 denominations.
				</p>

        <section class="faqs">
        <a id="Donations"><h3>Donations, Taxes, &amp; All Things Money</h3></a>
			<h4>Where are the books from?</h4>
				<p>
				  Most of our items are donations from individuals, estates, and companies, but we also sell books the Palo Alto Library has removed from their shelves. They regularly remove books and other items that haven’t circulated in a long time, and we're happy to accept them!
				</p>
			<h4>Can I bring donations?</h4>
				<p>
				  Absolutely! We always welcome book donations. You can bring them to the Main Room during the sale.
				</p>
			<h4>How much of the profit goes to the library?</h4>
				<p>
				  100% of your purchase is donated directly to the Palo Alto Library! 
				</p>
			<h4>Do you charge sales tax?</h4>
				<p>
				  No! Because 100% of all purchases is donated to the library, we do not charge sales tax.
