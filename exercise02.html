      <p>Hello, and thanks for venturing over to my little corner of the internet. I'm Heather, and the sweet little dreamer who greeted you is one of my cats, Trinity. She rules the house (it's definitely hers) and can melt the hearts of even the most staunchly cat-averse.</p>
  
      <p>A little known secret of hers is that she's one of the best bakers in town! She spends at least an hour every morning kneading biscuits to prepare for the day&mdash;a testament to her love for baked goods, considering how much she values her sleep.</p>

      <p>We hope you enjoy your time here, and remember to give Trinity a scratch behind the ears on your way out!</p>
